1) The author describes the different opportunities of crime for different types of people. The crime someone commits is dependent on what they need / want and which other options there are. He gives the example, that a somewhat higher up office worker would never rob a bank, because there are easier ways for them to illegally obtain money (e.g. embezzlement)
2) Crimes felt particularly disgusting by the average citizen / the general public are such crimes that have a direct victim and are also violent. The author also describes how white collar workers canÂ´t get the reasons behind lower class people doing violent crimes to earn money.

## Innocent until proven guilty

"Innocent until proven guilty" is a fundamental principle of the legal system followed in many democratic countries, often referred to as the presumption of innocence. This principle ensures that the burden of proof falls on the prosecution rather then the defendant, and the prosecutor is the one who must establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt (or in criminal trials also often called "without a shadow of a doubt" because the burden of proof is higher in a criminal trial then in a civil trial)


The concept is rooted in the belief that it is better to let a guilty person go free than to unjustly punish an innocent one. This principle safeguards individuals from being arbitrarily accused and punished without concrete evidence. It reflects the importance placed on individual rights and freedom in democratic societies.

However, this principle also raises certain debates. Critics argue that it can sometimes lead to guilty individuals escaping punishment due to lack of evidence or legal loopholes. On the other hand, proponents argue that the principle is essential for maintaining fairness and justice in the legal system.


In conclusion, "innocent until proven guilty" is a key aspect of the legal system that underscores the importance of evidence-based judgment and the protection of individual rights. Despite some criticism, it remains a cornerstone of justice in many countries, signifying the value placed on individual liberty and fair judgment.
