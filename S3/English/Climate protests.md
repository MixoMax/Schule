Recent Developments in Climate Protests:

- Climate protesters have adopted increasingly disruptive and strange tactics to get media attention, such as throwing food on famous paintings.
- Recent examples include throwing tomato soup on Van Gogh's "Sunflowers" painting in London's National Gallery, mashed potatoes on a Monet painting in Germany, and pie on a wax statue of King Charles.
- The protest groups, like Just Stop Oil and Ultima Generazione, say they are desperately trying to spur action on climate change. The stunts often go viral online.

Criticism of Tactics:

- Critics argue the disruptive tactics seem more likely to alienate people rather than inspire change. They spark more public anger, jokes, and disgust than substantive debate.
- Tactics like blocking commuters and defacing beloved art risk turning off people sympathetic to combatting climate change.
- Research shows these attention-grabbing stunts don't usually change minds or hearts. They may get temporary media buzz but not long-term momentum.
- While the stunts get attention short-term, it's unclear if they achieve protesters' ultimate goals long-term. Critics question "to what end?" beyond a brief viral moment.
