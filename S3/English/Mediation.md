Title: Working for the EU as a live interpreter (?)

A Live interpreter is someone who translates from one langauge to another on a live basis. In The EU parlament this is mainly needed for speeches in languages that the deputys dont understand. Politicians in the EU have the right to speak in their mother toungue and since the EU covers 27 countries with 23 different languages. Each of these 23 languages have to be understood by every politician who could speak one of the other 22 languages. That makes for a total of 506 possible language combinations.

The job comes with a lot of stress because a live interpreter is expected to listen to the speech in one language, look up words they dont know and translate and say the speech in the other target language.
