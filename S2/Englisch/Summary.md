## 03/04/2023: Famous British Speeches

Task: "Write just one paragraph for each speech in which you analyze the excerpt of the speech by identifying the means that are being used, explaining the effect of the means and quoting the speech"

### King George VI: Radio Address to the Nation (1939)

"in this grave hour, perhaps the most fateful in our history, I send to every household of my peoples, both at home and overseas, this message, spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if i were able to cross your threshold and speak to you myself. For the second time in the lives of most of us, we are at war."

### Summary:

King George VI's speech uses emotive language to establish a sense of gravity and urgency in his message. The use of the phrase "grave hour" and "fateful" evoke a somber and serious tone, which is further emphasized by the use of "every household" and "each one of you". This creates a sense of personal connection and responsibility, as if the King is speaking directly to each individual listening. The repetition of "we are at war" is a direct and powerful statement that immediately captures the attention of the audience and conveys the severity of the situation.

### Winston Churchill: "We shall fight on the beaches"

"... we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God's good time, the New World, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old."

### Summary:

In this excerpt from Winston Churchill's "We Shall Fight on the Beaches" speech, he uses repetition and vivid imagery to rally his audience and instill a sense of determination and hope. By repeating the phrase "we shall fight" and listing different locations where the fight will take place, Churchill creates a sense of unity and solidarity among his listeners. He also appeals to their patriotism and faith in their country's military might by mentioning the British fleet and the empire beyond the seas. Finally, Churchill ends on a hopeful note, by referencing the potential assistance of the New World, which creates a sense of optimism and a belief in ultimate victory.

### Emmiline Pankhurst: "Freedom or Death" (1913)

"You have left it to women in your land, the men of all civilised countries have left it to women, to work out their own salvation. That is the way in which we women of England are doing. Human life for us is sacred but we say if any life is to be sacrificed it shall ba ours; we wont do it ourselves, but we will put the enemy in the position where they will have to choose between giving us freedom or death."

### Skakespeare: Henry V, Act 3, Scene 1 (1598)

    Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;
    Or close the wall up with our English dead!
    In peace theres nothing so becomes a man
    As modest stillness and humility:
    But when the blast of war blows in our ears,
    Then imitate the action of the tiger;
    Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,
    Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;

### Summary:

In this excerpt from Shakespeare's Henry V, Act 3, Scene 1, the speaker employs a series of rhetorical devices to inspire his troops to continue fighting. The repetition of the phrase "once more" is used as a call to action, encouraging his friends to charge the enemy once again. The use of contrasting imagery of "modest stillness and humility" with "hard-favour'd rage" is meant to emphasize the change in behavior that is necessary for the soldiers to be successful in battle. The metaphor of the tiger suggests that they should be fierce and unrelenting in their attack.
